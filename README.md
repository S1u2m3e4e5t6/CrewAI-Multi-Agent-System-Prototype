# CrewAI Multi-Agent System Prototype

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **CrewAI-based multi-agent system** designed to demonstrate the orchestration of autonomous agents working collaboratively on complex tasks.  
Each agent has configurable behaviors and communicates with other agents to dynamically delegate, track, and complete tasks efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** – Multiple autonomous agents working together in real-time.
- **Dynamic Task Delegation** – Agents can assign and receive tasks based on workload and capabilities.
- **Inter-Agent Communication** – Seamless information exchange between agents.
- **Configurable Behaviors** – Define unique roles, skills, and objectives for each agent.
- **Extensible Architecture** – Easily add new agents or modify workflows.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core programming language.
- **CrewAI** – Multi-agent framework for task orchestration.
- **LangChain** – LLM orchestration and integration.
- **OpenAI API** – Natural language understanding and reasoning.
- **Streamlit (optional)** – Interactive UI for monitoring and controlling agents.

If you want, I can also make a **GitHub-ready version with visuals** — like an architecture diagram showing the CrewAI agents and their communication flow — so recruiters see it and instantly think *"Damn, this is pro work!"*.
